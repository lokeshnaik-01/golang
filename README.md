## PACKAGES
- a package is a way to organize and structure code. It provides a mechanism for grouping related Go source files together
- each go source file begins with a package declaration, indicating the package to which the file belongs.
- package main is a reserved package name which tells start point, we just run `go build` which creates a executable file, 
- we should have atleast once package per application or go code
- a single package can have multiple files

## MODULES
- one module consists of multiple packages
- modules provide a way to manage dependencies and versioning for your Go projects
